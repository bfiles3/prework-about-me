      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Hello, my name is Brittany and I am 26 years old. I am a technology lover, which is why I have been so interested in getting into software development as a career. I have a two year old daughter, who really is the reason that I want to change my career. I want to provide a better life for both her and myself, doing something I enjoy! I am really looking forward to starting this journey and expanding my knowledge while I learn a new skill.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I am from Delaware County, Pennsylvania. I live about twenty minutes outside of south Philadelphia.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>My favorite hobbies are spending time with my daughter, watching movies, writing music, and doing DIY projects! I'm currently in the process of remodeling my laundry room.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>I would absolutely love to work in app development, or front end software development. I love working on webpage aesthetics and making things pleasing to the eye while still being efficient.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I have traveled up and down the east coast, but I have been back home in Delaware County since my daughter was born in October of 2017.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I have always had a love of computers and technology. I am sure I am not the only person taking this class that used to spend time working on their MySpace! I've always spent a lot of time with computers and I seem to have a natural affinity for technology. I believe it could be a really fulfilling career for me.</p>
